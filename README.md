### What is Swift-Lite?
Swift-Lite is a super lean version of Swift 3 built for small arm SBC's like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone and the CHIP running Debian based Linux OS. This includes Raspbian, Ubuntu, Debian and others. Swift-Lite uses meta-tags combined with the pre-build processor to make constructing a multi-file Swift project with Module dependancies easy and simple. Swift Modules can be used in much the same way you would use a Framework or a Library.

Swift-Lite is built from the official repo on Swift.org. It includes Foundation, Dispatch and all the main core features of Swift. What it doesn't include are the Swift add-ons such as Package Manager, REPL, LLDB and XCTest.
